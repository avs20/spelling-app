# Use uv run, never python
# Prefer async over sync patterns
# Write at 9th grade level in documentation
# Avoid heavily mocking tests without user permission
# Update docs when code changes
# Never git add ., specify files
# Run linters/formatters before committing
# Type check before merging
# Run affected tests for changed files
